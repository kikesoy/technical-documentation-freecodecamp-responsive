      <p class="lead">Hugo’s CLI is fully featured but simple to use, even for those who have very limited experience working from the command line.</p>
      <p>The following is a description of the most common commands you will use while developing your Hugo project. See the Command Line Reference for a comprehensive view of Hugo’s CLI.</p>

      <p>Once you have installed Hugo, make sure it is in your PATH. You can test that Hugo has been installed correctly via the help command:</p>
      <code>hugo help</code>
      <p>The output you see in your console should be similar to the following:</p>

        The hugo Command
      </header>
      <p>The most common usage is probably to run hugo with your current directory being the input directory.</p>
      <p>This generates your website to the public/ directory by default, although you can customize the output directory in your site configuration by changing the publishDir field.</p>
      <p>The command hugo renders your site into public/ dir and is ready to be deployed to your web server:</p><pre>
  <code>
  hugo
  0 draft content
  0 future content
  99 pages created
  0 paginator pages created
  16 tags created
  0 groups created
  in 90 ms
  </code>
  </pre>
    </section>
    <section id="Draft_and_Future_and_Expired_Content" class="main-section">
      <header>
        Draft and Future and Expired Content
      </header>
      <p>Hugo allows you to set draft, publishdate, and even expirydate in your content’s front matter. By default, Hugo will not publish:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Content with a future publishdate value</li>
        <li>Content with draft: true status</li>
        <li>Content with a past expirydate value</li>
      </ol>
      <p>All three of these can be overridden during both local development and deployment by adding the following flags to hugo and hugo server, respectively, or by changing the boolean values assigned to the fields of the same name (without --) in your configuration:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>--buildFuture</li>
        <li>--buildDrafts</li>
        <li>--buildExpired</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="LiveReload" class="main-section">
      <header>
        LiveReload
      </header>
      <p>Hugo comes with LiveReload built in. There are no additional packages to install. A common way to use Hugo while developing a site is to have Hugo run a server with the hugo server command and watch for changes:</p>
  <pre>
  <code>
  hugo server
  0 draft content
  0 future content
  99 pages created
  0 paginator pages created
  16 tags created
  0 groups created
  in 120 ms
  Watching for changes in /Users/yourname/sites/yourhugosite/{data,content,layouts,static}
  Serving pages from /Users/yourname/sites/yourhugosite/public
  Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/
  Press Ctrl+C to stop
  </code>
  </pre>
      <p>This will run a fully functioning web server while simultaneously watching your file system for additions, deletions, or changes within the following areas of your project organization:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>/static/*</li>
        <li>/content/*</li>
        <li>/data/*</li>
        <li>/i18n/*</li>
        <li>/layouts/*</li>
        <li>/themes/<CURRENT-THEME>/*</li>
        <li>config</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whenever you make changes, Hugo will simultaneously rebuild the site and continue to serve content. As soon as the build is finished, LiveReload tells the browser to silently reload the page.</p>
      <p>Most Hugo builds are so fast that you may not notice the change unless looking directly at the site in your browser. This means that keeping the site open on a second monitor (or another half of your current monitor) allows you to see the most up-to-date version of your website without the need to leave your text editor.</p>
      <blockquote>
          Hugo injects the LiveReload |script| before the closing |body| in your templates and will therefore not work if this tag is not present..
      </blockquote>

    <section id="Deploy_Your_Website" class="main-section">
        <header>
          Deploy Your Website
        </header>
        <p>After running hugo server for local web development, you need to do a final hugo run without the server part of the command to rebuild your site. You may then deploy your site by copying the public/ directory to your production web server.</p>
        <p>Since Hugo generates a static website, your site can be hosted anywhere using any web server. See Hosting and Deployment for methods for hosting and automating deployments contributed by the Hugo community.</p>
        <blockquote>
            Running hugo does not remove generated files before building. This means that you should delete your public/ directory (or the publish directory you specified via flag or configuration file) before running the hugo command. If you do not remove these files, you run the risk of the wrong files (e.g., drafts or future posts) being left in the generated site.
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Dev vs Deploy Destinations</h3>
        <p>Hugo does not remove generated files before building. An easy workaround is to use different directories for development and production.</p>
        <p>To start a server that builds draft content (helpful for editing), you can specify a different destination; e.g., a dev/ directory:</p>
        <code>hugo server -wDs ~/Code/hugo/docs -d dev</code>
        <p>When the content is ready for publishing, use the default public/ dir:</p>
        <code>hugo -s ~/Code/hugo/docs</code>
        <p>This prevents draft content from accidentally becoming available.</p>
